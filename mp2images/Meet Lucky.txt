Meet Lucky, our Resident Baker

A.k.a Yen, was born and raised in Ilocos Sur. She enjoys traveling with her family and take photos of them, but if you check her profile, she also loves taking photos of her friends and nature. Not many know that she has a natural talent in cooking local "ulam" dishes.

Baking is not her first love.  
She graduated in Far Eastern University and got her license as a Nurse. 
But after working briefly in the hospital, she decided, it's time to move on. It's not too long ago, when she started her own journey towards personal development and found happines in baking.
Trained and dedicated most of her time in making recipes since 2020 before sharing her freshly baked products to the public. 

That's how Lucky's Baked Goods was born. It is a start-up business that bakes cakes, cheesecakes, cupcakes, bread, and cookies fresh from home. Tried and tested by her family, friends and the neighborhood.

"Great things start from small beginnings."
